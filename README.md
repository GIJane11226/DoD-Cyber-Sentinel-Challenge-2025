# 🛡️ DoD Cyber Sentinel Challenge 2025 Recap🛡️ #

Today was one of the most exciting—and stressful—days of my cybersecurity journey so far.
I first learned about the **DoD Cyber Sentinel Challenge** through the **GovTech Blueprint Skool** community. When I got the acceptance email, I was genuinely shocked—I even thought it might’ve been a mistake. This was my very first time competing in a DoD-level Capture the Flag event, and I’ll admit, I had serious doubts about whether I could hold my own against more seasoned participants.
But I made the decision to show up, embrace the challenge, and treat it as a learning opportunity. I’m glad I did.
Out of 2,151 participants who made it onto the leaderboard, I ranked #767, earning a total of 1,200 points, although my final score was 975 after revisiting and wrestling with some of the tougher challenges. Every point earned was hard-fought and full of lessons.
This experience pushed me outside of my comfort zone and showed me just how much I’ve grown—and how much further I’m excited to go in this field.
